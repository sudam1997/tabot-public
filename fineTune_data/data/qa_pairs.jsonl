Examples of such \napplications are office applications on a PC, CAD programs, photo manipula-\ntion software, travel apps, productivity apps, and so on.\n2. Interactive transaction-based applications These are applications that execute \non a remote computer and that are accessed by users from their own computers, \nphones, or tablets. Obviously, these include web applications such as e-commerce \napplications where you interact with a remote system to buy goods and services. \nThis class of application also includes business systems, where a business \nprovides access to its systems through a web browser or special-purpose client \nprogram and cloud-based services, such as mail and photo sharing. Interactive \napplications often incorporate a large data store that is accessed and updated in \neach transaction.\n3. Embedded control systems These are software control systems that control and \nmanage hardware devices. Numerically, there are probably more embedded sys-\ntems than any other type of system. Examples of embedded systems include the \nsoftware in a mobile (cell) phone, software that controls antilock braking in a \ncar, and software in a microwave oven to control the cooking process.\n4. Batch processing systems These are business systems that are designed to pro-\ncess data in large batches. They process large numbers of individual inputs to \ncreate corresponding outputs. Examples of batch systems are periodic billing \nsystems, such as phone billing systems, and salary payment systems.\n5. Entertainment systems These are systems for personal use that are intended to \nentertain the user. Most of these systems are games of one kind or another, \nwhich may run on special-purpose console hardware. The quality of the user \ninteraction offered is the most important distinguishing characteristic of enter-\ntainment systems.\n6. Systems for modeling and simulation These are systems that are developed by \nscientists and engineers to model physical processes or situations, which include \nmany separate, interacting objects. These are often computationally intensive \nand require high-performance parallel systems for execution.\n7. Data collection and analysis systems Data collection systems are systems that \ncollect data from their environment and send that data to other systems for pro-\ncessing. The software may have to interact with sensors and often is installed in \na hostile environment such as inside an engine or in a remote location. \u201cBig \ndata\u201d analysis may involve cloud-based systems carrying out statistical analysis \nand looking for relationships in the collected data.\n8.

Examples of batch systems are periodic billing \nsystems, such as phone billing systems, and salary payment systems.\n5. Entertainment systems These are systems for personal use that are intended to \nentertain the user.

Data collection and analysis systems Data collection systems are systems that \ncollect data from their environment and send that data to other systems for pro-\ncessing.

Heterogeneity Increasingly, systems are required to operate as distributed sys-\ntems across networks that include different types of computer and mobile \ndevices. As well as running on general-purpose computers, software may also \nhave to execute on mobile phones and tablets. You often have to integrate new \nsoftware with older legacy systems written in different programming languages. \nThe challenge here is to develop techniques for building dependable software \nthat is flexible enough to cope with this heterogeneity.\n2. Business and social change Businesses and society are changing incredibly \nquickly as emerging economies develop and new technologies become availa-\nble. They need to be able to change their existing software and to rapidly \ndevelop new software. Many traditional software engineering techniques are \ntime consuming, and delivery of new systems often takes longer than planned. \nThey need to evolve so that the time required for software to deliver value to its \ncustomers is reduced.\n3. Security and trust As software is intertwined with all aspects of our lives, it is \nessential that we can trust that software. This is especially true for remote soft-\nware systems accessed through a web page or web service interface. We have to \nmake sure that malicious users cannot successfully attack our software and that \ninformation security is maintained.\n4. Scale Software has to be developed across a very wide range of scales, from \nvery small embedded systems in portable or wearable devices through to \nInternet-scale, cloud-based systems that serve a global community.\nTo address these challenges, we will need new tools and techniques as well as \ninnovative ways of combining and using existing software engineering methods.\n \n1.1.2  Software engineering diversity\nSoftware engineering is a systematic approach to the production of software \nthat takes into account practical cost, schedule, and dependability issues, as \nwell as the needs of software customers and producers. The specific methods, \ntools, and techniques used depend on the organization developing the software, \nthe type of software, and the people involved in the development process. There \nare no universal software engineering methods that are suitable for all systems \nand all companies. Rather, a diverse set of software engineering methods and \ntools has evolved over the past 50 years. However, the SEMAT initiative \n(Jacobson et al. 2013) proposes that there can be a fundamental meta-process \nthat can be instantiated to create different kinds of process. This is at an early \nstage of development and may be a basis for improving our current software \nengineering methods.\nPerhaps the most significant factor in determining which software engineering \nmethods and techniques are most important is the type of application being devel-\noped. There are many different types of application, including:\n\n\n\u2002\n1.1\u2002 \u25a0\u2002 Professional\u2002software\u2002development\u2002 \u2002 25\n1. Stand-alone applications These are application systems that run on a personal \ncomputer or apps that run on a mobile device. They include all necessary func-\ntionality and may not need to be connected to a network. Examples of such \napplications are office applications on a PC, CAD programs, photo manipula-\ntion software, travel apps, productivity apps, and so on.\n2. Interactive transaction-based applications These are applications that execute \non a remote computer and that are accessed by users from their own computers, \nphones, or tablets. Obviously, these include web applications such as e-commerce \napplications where you interact with a remote system to buy goods and services. \nThis class of application also includes business systems, where a business \nprovides access to its systems through a web browser or special-purpose client \nprogram and cloud-based services, such as mail and photo sharing. Interactive \napplications often incorporate a large data store that is accessed and updated in \neach transaction.\n3. Embedded control systems These are software control systems that control and \nmanage hardware devices. Numerically, there are probably more embedded sys-\ntems than any other type of system. Examples of embedded systems include the \nsoftware in a mobile (cell) phone, software that controls antilock braking in a \ncar, and software in a microwave oven to control the cooking process.\n4. Batch processing systems These are business systems that are designed to pro-\ncess data in large batches. They process large numbers of individual inputs to \ncreate corresponding outputs. Examples of batch systems are periodic billing \nsystems, such as phone billing systems, and salary payment systems.\n5. Entertainment systems These are systems for personal use that are intended to \nentertain the user. Most of these systems are games of one kind or another, \nwhich may run on special-purpose console hardware. The quality of the user \ninteraction offered is the most important distinguishing characteristic of enter-\ntainment systems.\n6. Systems for modeling and simulation These are systems that are developed by \nscientists and engineers to model physical processes or situations, which include \nmany separate, interacting objects. These are often computationally intensive \nand require high-performance parallel systems for execution.\n7. Data collection and analysis systems Data collection systems are systems that \ncollect data from their environment and send that data to other systems for pro-\ncessing. The software may have to interact with sensors and often is installed in \na hostile environment such as inside an engine or in a remote location. \u201cBig \ndata\u201d analysis may involve cloud-based systems carrying out statistical analysis \nand looking for relationships in the collected data.\n8. Systems of systems These are systems, used in enterprises and other large organ-\nizations, that are composed of a number of other software systems. Some of \nthese may be generic software products, such as an ERP system. Other systems \nin the assembly may be specially written for that environment."}

These systems ran \non local computers and were only accessible from within an organization. Around \n2000, the web started to evolve, and more and more functionality was added to \nbrowsers. This meant that web-based systems could be developed where, instead \nof a special-purpose user interface, these systems could be accessed using a web \nbrowser. This led to the development of a vast range of new system products that \ndelivered innovative services, accessed over the web. These are often funded by \nadverts that are displayed on the user\u2019s screen and do not involve direct payment \nfrom users.\nAs well as these system products, the development of web browsers that could \nrun small programs and do some local processing led to an evolution in business and \norganizational software. Instead of writing software and deploying it on users\u2019 PCs, \nthe software was deployed on a web server. This made it much cheaper to change \nand upgrade the software, as there was no need to install the software on every PC. \nIt also reduced costs, as user interface development is particularly expensive. \nWherever it has been possible to do so, businesses have moved to web-based inter-\naction with company software systems.\nThe notion of software as a service (Chapter 17) was proposed early in the 21st \ncentury This has now become the standard approach to the delivery of web-based \nsystem products such as Google Apps, Microsoft Office 365, and Adobe Creative \nSuite. More and more software runs on remote \u201cclouds\u201d instead of local servers and \nis accessed over the Internet. A computing cloud is a huge number of linked com-\nputer systems that is shared by many users.

For example, an embedded control system \nin an automobile is safety-critical and is burned into ROM (read-only memory) \nwhen installed in the vehicle. It is therefore very expensive to change. Such a system \nneeds extensive verification and validation so that the chances of having to recall \ncars after sale to fix software problems are minimized. User interaction is minimal \n(or perhaps nonexistent), so there is no need to use a development process that relies \non user interface prototyping.\nFor an interactive web-based system or app, iterative development and delivery is \nthe best approach, with the system being composed of reusable components. \nHowever, such an approach may be impractical for a system of systems, where \ndetailed specifications of the system interactions have to be specified in advance so \nthat each system can be separately developed.\nNevertheless, there are software engineering fundamentals that apply to all types \nof software systems:\n1. They should be developed using a managed and understood development pro-\ncess. The organization developing the software should plan the development \nprocess and have clear ideas of what will be produced and when it will be com-\npleted. Of course, the specific process that you should use depends on the type \nof software that you are developing.\n2. Dependability and performance are important for all types of system. Software \nshould behave as expected, without failures, and should be available for use \nwhen it is required. It should be safe in its operation and, as far as possible, \nshould be secure against external attack. The system should perform efficiently \nand should not waste resources.\n3. Understanding and managing the software specification and requirements (what \nthe software should do) are important.

Initially, the web was primarily a universally accessible \ninformation store, and it had little effect on software systems. These systems ran \non local computers and were only accessible from within an organization. Around \n2000, the web started to evolve, and more and more functionality was added to \nbrowsers. This meant that web-based systems could be developed where, instead \nof a special-purpose user interface, these systems could be accessed using a web \nbrowser. This led to the development of a vast range of new system products that \ndelivered innovative services, accessed over the web. These are often funded by \nadverts that are displayed on the user\u2019s screen and do not involve direct payment \nfrom users.\nAs well as these system products, the development of web browsers that could \nrun small programs and do some local processing led to an evolution in business and \norganizational software. Instead of writing software and deploying it on users\u2019 PCs, \nthe software was deployed on a web server. This made it much cheaper to change \nand upgrade the software, as there was no need to install the software on every PC. \nIt also reduced costs, as user interface development is particularly expensive. \nWherever it has been possible to do so, businesses have moved to web-based inter-\naction with company software systems.\nThe notion of software as a service (Chapter 17) was proposed early in the 21st \ncentury This has now become the standard approach to the delivery of web-based \nsystem products such as Google Apps, Microsoft Office 365, and Adobe Creative \nSuite. More and more software runs on remote \u201cclouds\u201d instead of local servers and \nis accessed over the Internet. A computing cloud is a huge number of linked com-\nputer systems that is shared by many users. Users do not buy software but pay \naccording to how much the software is used or are given free access in return for \nwatching adverts that are displayed on their screen.

Initially, the web was primarily a universally accessible \ninformation store, and it had little effect on software systems. These systems ran \non local computers and were only accessible from within an organization. Around \n2000, the web started to evolve, and more and more functionality was added to \nbrowsers. This meant that web-based systems could be developed where, instead \nof a special-purpose user interface, these systems could be accessed using a web \nbrowser. This led to the development of a vast range of new system products that \ndelivered innovative services, accessed over the web. These are often funded by \nadverts that are displayed on the user\u2019s screen and do not involve direct payment \nfrom users.\nAs well as these system products, the development of web browsers that could \nrun small programs and do some local processing led to an evolution in business and \norganizational software. Instead of writing software and deploying it on users\u2019 PCs, \nthe software was deployed on a web server. This made it much cheaper to change \nand upgrade the software, as there was no need to install the software on every PC. \nIt also reduced costs, as user interface development is particularly expensive. \nWherever it has been possible to do so, businesses have moved to web-based inter-\naction with company software systems.\nThe notion of software as a service (Chapter 17) was proposed early in the 21st \ncentury This has now become the standard approach to the delivery of web-based \nsystem products such as Google Apps, Microsoft Office 365, and Adobe Creative \nSuite. More and more software runs on remote \u201cclouds\u201d instead of local servers and \nis accessed over the Internet. A computing cloud is a huge number of linked com-\nputer systems that is shared by many users. Users do not buy software but pay \naccording to how much the software is used or are given free access in return for \nwatching adverts that are displayed on their screen. If you use services such as web-\nbased mail, storage, or video, you are using a cloud-based system.\nThe advent of the web has led to a dramatic change in the way that business soft-\nware is organized. Before the web, business applications were mostly monolithic, \nsingle programs running on single computers or computer clusters. Communications \nwere local, within an organization. Now, software is highly distributed, sometimes \nacross the world. Business applications are not programmed from scratch but involve \nextensive reuse of components and programs.\nThis change in software organization has had a major effect on software engi-\nneering for web-based systems.

These systems ran \non local computers and were only accessible from within an organization. Around \n2000, the web started to evolve, and more and more functionality was added to \nbrowsers. This meant that web-based systems could be developed where, instead \nof a special-purpose user interface, these systems could be accessed using a web \nbrowser. This led to the development of a vast range of new system products that \ndelivered innovative services, accessed over the web. These are often funded by \nadverts that are displayed on the user\u2019s screen and do not involve direct payment \nfrom users.\nAs well as these system products, the development of web browsers that could \nrun small programs and do some local processing led to an evolution in business and \norganizational software. Instead of writing software and deploying it on users\u2019 PCs, \nthe software was deployed on a web server. This made it much cheaper to change \nand upgrade the software, as there was no need to install the software on every PC. \nIt also reduced costs, as user interface development is particularly expensive. \nWherever it has been possible to do so, businesses have moved to web-based inter-\naction with company software systems.\nThe notion of software as a service (Chapter 17) was proposed early in the 21st \ncentury This has now become the standard approach to the delivery of web-based \nsystem products such as Google Apps, Microsoft Office 365, and Adobe Creative \nSuite. More and more software runs on remote \u201cclouds\u201d instead of local servers and \nis accessed over the Internet. A computing cloud is a huge number of linked com-\nputer systems that is shared by many users.

These systems ran \non local computers and were only accessible from within an organization. Around \n2000, the web started to evolve, and more and more functionality was added to \nbrowsers. This meant that web-based systems could be developed where, instead \nof a special-purpose user interface, these systems could be accessed using a web \nbrowser. This led to the development of a vast range of new system products that \ndelivered innovative services, accessed over the web. These are often funded by \nadverts that are displayed on the user\u2019s screen and do not involve direct payment \nfrom users.\nAs well as these system products, the development of web browsers that could \nrun small programs and do some local processing led to an evolution in business and \norganizational software. Instead of writing software and deploying it on users\u2019 PCs, \nthe software was deployed on a web server. This made it much cheaper to change \nand upgrade the software, as there was no need to install the software on every PC. \nIt also reduced costs, as user interface development is particularly expensive. \nWherever it has been possible to do so, businesses have moved to web-based inter-\naction with company software systems.\nThe notion of software as a service (Chapter 17) was proposed early in the 21st \ncentury This has now become the standard approach to the delivery of web-based \nsystem products such as Google Apps, Microsoft Office 365, and Adobe Creative \nSuite.

A computing cloud is a huge number of linked com-\nputer systems that is shared by many users.

Initially, the web was primarily a universally accessible \ninformation store, and it had little effect on software systems. These systems ran \non local computers and were only accessible from within an organization. Around \n2000, the web started to evolve, and more and more functionality was added to \nbrowsers. This meant that web-based systems could be developed where, instead \nof a special-purpose user interface, these systems could be accessed using a web \nbrowser. This led to the development of a vast range of new system products that \ndelivered innovative services, accessed over the web. These are often funded by \nadverts that are displayed on the user\u2019s screen and do not involve direct payment \nfrom users.\nAs well as these system products, the development of web browsers that could \nrun small programs and do some local processing led to an evolution in business and \norganizational software. Instead of writing software and deploying it on users\u2019 PCs, \nthe software was deployed on a web server. This made it much cheaper to change \nand upgrade the software, as there was no need to install the software on every PC. \nIt also reduced costs, as user interface development is particularly expensive. \nWherever it has been possible to do so, businesses have moved to web-based inter-\naction with company software systems.\nThe notion of software as a service (Chapter 17) was proposed early in the 21st \ncentury This has now become the standard approach to the delivery of web-based \nsystem products such as Google Apps, Microsoft Office 365, and Adobe Creative \nSuite. More and more software runs on remote \u201cclouds\u201d instead of local servers and \nis accessed over the Internet. A computing cloud is a huge number of linked com-\nputer systems that is shared by many users. Users do not buy software but pay \naccording to how much the software is used or are given free access in return for \nwatching adverts that are displayed on their screen. If you use services such as web-\nbased mail, storage, or video, you are using a cloud-based system.\nThe advent of the web has led to a dramatic change in the way that business soft-\nware is organized. Before the web, business applications were mostly monolithic, \nsingle programs running on single computers or computer clusters. Communications \nwere local, within an organization.

These systems ran \non local computers and were only accessible from within an organization. Around \n2000, the web started to evolve, and more and more functionality was added to \nbrowsers. This meant that web-based systems could be developed where, instead \nof a special-purpose user interface, these systems could be accessed using a web \nbrowser. This led to the development of a vast range of new system products that \ndelivered innovative services, accessed over the web. These are often funded by \nadverts that are displayed on the user\u2019s screen and do not involve direct payment \nfrom users.\nAs well as these system products, the development of web browsers that could \nrun small programs and do some local processing led to an evolution in business and \norganizational software. Instead of writing software and deploying it on users\u2019 PCs, \nthe software was deployed on a web server. This made it much cheaper to change \nand upgrade the software, as there was no need to install the software on every PC. \nIt also reduced costs, as user interface development is particularly expensive. \nWherever it has been possible to do so, businesses have moved to web-based inter-\naction with company software systems.\nThe notion of software as a service (Chapter 17) was proposed early in the 21st \ncentury This has now become the standard approach to the delivery of web-based \nsystem products such as Google Apps, Microsoft Office 365, and Adobe Creative \nSuite. More and more software runs on remote \u201cclouds\u201d instead of local servers and \nis accessed over the Internet. A computing cloud is a huge number of linked com-\nputer systems that is shared by many users.

If you use services such as web-\nbased mail, storage, or video, you are using a cloud-based system.\nThe advent of the web has led to a dramatic change in the way that business soft-\nware is organized.

Initially, the web was primarily a universally accessible \ninformation store, and it had little effect on software systems. These systems ran \non local computers and were only accessible from within an organization. Around \n2000, the web started to evolve, and more and more functionality was added to \nbrowsers. This meant that web-based systems could be developed where, instead \nof a special-purpose user interface, these systems could be accessed using a web \nbrowser. This led to the development of a vast range of new system products that \ndelivered innovative services, accessed over the web. These are often funded by \nadverts that are displayed on the user\u2019s screen and do not involve direct payment \nfrom users.\nAs well as these system products, the development of web browsers that could \nrun small programs and do some local processing led to an evolution in business and \norganizational software. Instead of writing software and deploying it on users\u2019 PCs, \nthe software was deployed on a web server. This made it much cheaper to change \nand upgrade the software, as there was no need to install the software on every PC. \nIt also reduced costs, as user interface development is particularly expensive. \nWherever it has been possible to do so, businesses have moved to web-based inter-\naction with company software systems.\nThe notion of software as a service (Chapter 17) was proposed early in the 21st \ncentury This has now become the standard approach to the delivery of web-based \nsystem products such as Google Apps, Microsoft Office 365, and Adobe Creative \nSuite. More and more software runs on remote \u201cclouds\u201d instead of local servers and \nis accessed over the Internet. A computing cloud is a huge number of linked com-\nputer systems that is shared by many users. Users do not buy software but pay \naccording to how much the software is used or are given free access in return for \nwatching adverts that are displayed on their screen. If you use services such as web-\nbased mail, storage, or video, you are using a cloud-based system.\nThe advent of the web has led to a dramatic change in the way that business soft-\nware is organized. Before the web, business applications were mostly monolithic, \nsingle programs running on single computers or computer clusters. Communications \nwere local, within an organization. Now, software is highly distributed, sometimes \nacross the world. Business applications are not programmed from scratch but involve \nextensive reuse of components and programs.\nThis change in software organization has had a major effect on software engi-\nneering for web-based systems.

These systems ran \non local computers and were only accessible from within an organization. Around \n2000, the web started to evolve, and more and more functionality was added to \nbrowsers. This meant that web-based systems could be developed where, instead \nof a special-purpose user interface, these systems could be accessed using a web \nbrowser. This led to the development of a vast range of new system products that \ndelivered innovative services, accessed over the web. These are often funded by \nadverts that are displayed on the user\u2019s screen and do not involve direct payment \nfrom users.\nAs well as these system products, the development of web browsers that could \nrun small programs and do some local processing led to an evolution in business and \norganizational software. Instead of writing software and deploying it on users\u2019 PCs, \nthe software was deployed on a web server. This made it much cheaper to change \nand upgrade the software, as there was no need to install the software on every PC. \nIt also reduced costs, as user interface development is particularly expensive. \nWherever it has been possible to do so, businesses have moved to web-based inter-\naction with company software systems.\nThe notion of software as a service (Chapter 17) was proposed early in the 21st \ncentury This has now become the standard approach to the delivery of web-based \nsystem products such as Google Apps, Microsoft Office 365, and Adobe Creative \nSuite. More and more software runs on remote \u201cclouds\u201d instead of local servers and \nis accessed over the Internet. A computing cloud is a huge number of linked com-\nputer systems that is shared by many users.

User interaction is minimal \n(or perhaps nonexistent), so there is no need to use a development process that relies \non user interface prototyping.\nFor an interactive web-based system or app, iterative development and delivery is \nthe best approach, with the system being composed of reusable components. \nHowever, such an approach may be impractical for a system of systems, where \ndetailed specifications of the system interactions have to be specified in advance so \nthat each system can be separately developed.\nNevertheless, there are software engineering fundamentals that apply to all types \nof software systems:\n1. They should be developed using a managed and understood development pro-\ncess. The organization developing the software should plan the development \nprocess and have clear ideas of what will be produced and when it will be com-\npleted. Of course, the specific process that you should use depends on the type \nof software that you are developing.\n2. Dependability and performance are important for all types of system. Software \nshould behave as expected, without failures, and should be available for use \nwhen it is required. It should be safe in its operation and, as far as possible, \nshould be secure against external attack. The system should perform efficiently \nand should not waste resources.\n3. Understanding and managing the software specification and requirements (what \nthe software should do) are important. You have to know what different custom-\ners and users of the system expect from it, and you have to manage their expec-\ntations so that a useful system can be delivered within budget and to schedule.\n4. You should make effective use of existing resources. This means that, where \nappropriate, you should reuse software that has already been developed rather \nthan write new software.\nThese fundamental notions of process, dependability, requirements, manage-\nment, and reuse are important themes of this book. Different methods reflect them in \ndifferent ways, but they underlie all professional software development.\n\n\n\u2002\n1.1\u2002 \u25a0\u2002 Professional\u2002software\u2002development\u2002 \u2002 27\nThese fundamentals are independent of the program language used for software \ndevelopment. I don\u2019t cover specific programming techniques in this book because \nthese vary dramatically from one type of system to another. For example, a dynamic \nlanguage, such as Ruby, is the right type of language for interactive system develop-\nment but is inappropriate for embedded systems engineering.\n \n1.1.3  Internet software engineering\nThe development of the Internet and the World Wide Web has had a profound \neffect on all of our lives. Initially, the web was primarily a universally accessible \ninformation store, and it had little effect on software systems. These systems ran \non local computers and were only accessible from within an organization. Around \n2000, the web started to evolve, and more and more functionality was added to \nbrowsers. This meant that web-based systems could be developed where, instead \nof a special-purpose user interface, these systems could be accessed using a web \nbrowser. This led to the development of a vast range of new system products that \ndelivered innovative services, accessed over the web. These are often funded by \nadverts that are displayed on the user\u2019s screen and do not involve direct payment \nfrom users.\nAs well as these system products, the development of web browsers that could \nrun small programs and do some local processing led to an evolution in business and \norganizational software. Instead of writing software and deploying it on users\u2019 PCs, \nthe software was deployed on a web server. This made it much cheaper to change \nand upgrade the software, as there was no need to install the software on every PC. \nIt also reduced costs, as user interface development is particularly expensive. \nWherever it has been possible to do so, businesses have moved to web-based inter-\naction with company software systems.\nThe notion of software as a service (Chapter 17) was proposed early in the 21st \ncentury This has now become the standard approach to the delivery of web-based \nsystem products such as Google Apps, Microsoft Office 365, and Adobe Creative \nSuite. More and more software runs on remote \u201cclouds\u201d instead of local servers and \nis accessed over the Internet. A computing cloud is a huge number of linked com-\nputer systems that is shared by many users. Users do not buy software but pay \naccording to how much the software is used or are given free access in return for \nwatching adverts that are displayed on their screen. If you use services such as web-\nbased mail, storage, or video, you are using a cloud-based system.\nThe advent of the web has led to a dramatic change in the way that business soft-\nware is organized. Before the web, business applications were mostly monolithic, \nsingle programs running on single computers or computer clusters. Communications \nwere local, within an organization. Now, software is highly distributed, sometimes \nacross the world. Business applications are not programmed from scratch but involve \nextensive reuse of components and programs.\nThis change in software organization has had a major effect on software engi-\nneering for web-based systems. For example:"}

{"query": "What is the problem with having no absolutes when it comes to safety?", "response": "The problem with having no absolutes when it comes to safety is that it makes it difficult to determine whether a system is truly safe or not. Without predefined criteria for validation, there is no clear standard to measure the safety of a system. This can lead to uncertainty and potential risks, as a system that has not been properly validated may still operate safely or it may fail and cause an accident. The lack of absolutes in safety also creates ethical dilemmas, as the decision on whether to disclose problems or not depends on individual views and the potential for damage.", "context": "1.3\u2002 \u25a0\u2002 Case\u2002studies\u2002 \u2002 31\nThe problem here is that there are no absolutes when it comes to safety. Although \nthe system may not have been validated according to predefined criteria, these \n criteria may be too strict. The system may actually operate safely throughout its life-\ntime. It is also the case that, even when properly validated, the system may fail and \ncause an accident. Early disclosure of problems may result in damage to the employer \nand other employees; failure to disclose problems may result in damage to others.\nYou must make up your own mind in these matters. The appropriate ethical posi-\ntion here depends on the views of the people involved. The potential for damage, the \nextent of the damage, and the people affected by the damage should influence the \ndecision. If the situation is very dangerous, it may be justified to publicize it using \nthe national press or social media. However, you should always try to resolve the \nsituation while respecting the rights of your employer.\nAnother ethical issue is participation in the development of military and nuclear \nsystems. Some people feel strongly about these issues and do not wish to participate in \nany systems development associated with defense systems. Others will work on mili-\ntary systems but not on weapons systems. Yet others feel that national security is an \noverriding principle and have no ethical objections to working on weapons systems.\nIn this situation, it is important that both employers and employees should make \ntheir views known to each other in advance. Where an organization is involved in \nmilitary or nuclear work, it should be able to specify that employees must be willing \nto accept any work assignment. Equally, if an employee is taken on and makes clear \nthat he or she does not wish to work on such systems, employers should not exert \npressure to do so at some later date.\nThe general area of ethics and professional responsibility is increasingly important \nas software-intensive systems pervade every aspect of work and everyday life. It can \nbe considered from a philosophical standpoint where the basic principles of ethics are \nconsidered and software engineering ethics are discussed with reference to these \nbasic principles. This is the approach taken by Laudon (Laudon 1995) and Johnson \n(Johnson 2001). More recent texts such as that by Tavani (Tavani 2013) introduce the \nnotion of cyberethics and cover both the philosophical background and practical and \nlegal issues. They include ethical issues for technology users as well as developers.\nI find that a philosophical approach is too abstract and difficult to relate to every-\nday experience so I prefer the more concrete approach embodied in professional \ncodes of conduct (Bott 2005; Duquenoy 2007). I think that ethics are best discussed \nin a software engineering context and not as a subject in its own right. Therefore, I \ndo not discuss software engineering ethics in an abstract way but include examples \nin the exercises that can be the starting point for a group discussion.\n \n1.3 Case studies\nTo illustrate software engineering concepts, I use examples from four different types \nof system. I have deliberately not used a single case study, as one of the key messages \nin this book is that software engineering practice depends on the type of systems \n\n\n32\u2002 \u2002 Chapter\u20021\u2002 \u25a0\u2002 Introduction\nbeing produced. I therefore choose an appropriate example when discussing con-\ncepts such as safety and dependability, system modeling, reuse, etc.\nThe system types that I use as case studies are:\n1. An embedded system This is a system where the software controls some hard-\nware device and is embedded in that device. Issues in embedded systems typi-\ncally include physical size, responsiveness, and power management, etc. The \nexample of an embedded system that I use is a software system to control an \ninsulin pump for people who have diabetes.\n2. An information system The primary purpose of this type of system is to manage \nand provide access to a database of information. Issues in information systems \ninclude security, usability, privacy, and maintaining data integrity. The example \nof an information system used is a medical records system.\n3. A sensor-based data collection system This is a system whose primary purposes \nare to collect data from a set of sensors and to process that data in some way. \nThe key requirements of such systems are reliability, even in hostile environ-\nmental conditions, and maintainability.

An embedded system This is a system where the software controls some hard-\nware device and is embedded in that device. Issues in embedded systems typi-\ncally include physical size, responsiveness, and power management, etc. The \nexample of an embedded system that I use is a software system to control an \ninsulin pump for people who have diabetes.\n2. An information system The primary purpose of this type of system is to manage \nand provide access to a database of information. Issues in information systems \ninclude security, usability, privacy, and maintaining data integrity. The example \nof an information system used is a medical records system.\n3. A sensor-based data collection system This is a system whose primary purposes \nare to collect data from a set of sensors and to process that data in some way. \nThe key requirements of such systems are reliability, even in hostile environ-\nmental conditions, and maintainability. The example of a data collection system \nthat I use is a wilderness weather station.\n4. A support environment. This is an integrated collection of software tools that are \nused to support some kind of activity.

Irregular checking can \nlead to very low levels of blood glucose (if there is too much insulin) or very high \nlevels of blood sugar (if there is too little insulin). Low blood glucose is, in the short \nterm, a more serious condition as it can result in temporary brain malfunctioning and,"}

An embedded system This is a system where the software controls some hard-\nware device and is embedded in that device. Issues in embedded systems typi-\ncally include physical size, responsiveness, and power management, etc. The \nexample of an embedded system that I use is a software system to control an \ninsulin pump for people who have diabetes.\n2. An information system The primary purpose of this type of system is to manage \nand provide access to a database of information. Issues in information systems \ninclude security, usability, privacy, and maintaining data integrity. The example \nof an information system used is a medical records system.\n3. A sensor-based data collection system This is a system whose primary purposes \nare to collect data from a set of sensors and to process that data in some way. \nThe key requirements of such systems are reliability, even in hostile environ-\nmental conditions, and maintainability. The example of a data collection system \nthat I use is a wilderness weather station.\n4. A support environment. This is an integrated collection of software tools that are \nused to support some kind of activity. Programming environments, such as \nEclipse (Vogel 2012) will be the most familiar type of environment for readers \nof this book. I describe an example here of a digital learning environment that \nis\u00a0used to support students\u2019 learning in schools.\nI introduce each of these systems in this chapter; more information about each of \nthem is available on the website (software-engineering-book.com).\n \n1.3.1  An insulin pump control system\nAn insulin pump is a medical system that simulates the operation of the pancreas (an \ninternal organ). The software controlling this system is an embedded system that \ncollects information from a sensor and controls a pump that delivers a controlled \ndose of insulin to a user.\nPeople who suffer from diabetes use the system. Diabetes is a relatively common \ncondition in which the human pancreas is unable to produce sufficient quantities of \na hormone called insulin. Insulin metabolizes glucose (sugar) in the blood. The con-\nventional treatment of diabetes involves regular injections of genetically engineered \ninsulin. Diabetics measure their blood sugar levels periodically using an external \nmeter and then estimate the dose of insulin they should inject.\nThe problem is that the level of insulin required does not just depend on the blood \nglucose level but also on the time of the last insulin injection. Irregular checking can \nlead to very low levels of blood glucose (if there is too much insulin) or very high \nlevels of blood sugar (if there is too little insulin). Low blood glucose is, in the short \nterm, a more serious condition as it can result in temporary brain malfunctioning and,"}

An information system The primary purpose of this type of system is to manage \nand provide access to a database of information.

A sensor-based data collection system This is a system whose primary purposes \nare to collect data from a set of sensors and to process that data in some way. \nThe key requirements of such systems are reliability, even in hostile environ-\nmental conditions, and maintainability. The example of a data collection system \nthat I use is a wilderness weather station.\n4. A support environment. This is an integrated collection of software tools that are \nused to support some kind of activity.

I describe an example here of a digital learning environment that \nis\u00a0used to support students\u2019 learning in schools.\nI introduce each of these systems in this chapter; more information about each of \nthem is available on the website (software-engineering-book.com).\n \n1.3.1  An insulin pump control system\nAn insulin pump is a medical system that simulates the operation of the pancreas (an \ninternal organ). The software controlling this system is an embedded system that \ncollects information from a sensor and controls a pump that delivers a controlled \ndose of insulin to a user.\nPeople who suffer from diabetes use the system. Diabetes is a relatively common \ncondition in which the human pancreas is unable to produce sufficient quantities of \na hormone called insulin. Insulin metabolizes glucose (sugar) in the blood. The con-\nventional treatment of diabetes involves regular injections of genetically engineered \ninsulin. Diabetics measure their blood sugar levels periodically using an external \nmeter and then estimate the dose of insulin they should inject.\nThe problem is that the level of insulin required does not just depend on the blood \nglucose level but also on the time of the last insulin injection. Irregular checking can \nlead to very low levels of blood glucose (if there is too much insulin) or very high \nlevels of blood sugar (if there is too little insulin). Low blood glucose is, in the short \nterm, a more serious condition as it can result in temporary brain malfunctioning and,"}

Although \nthe system may not have been validated according to predefined criteria, these \n criteria may be too strict. The system may actually operate safely throughout its life-\ntime. It is also the case that, even when properly validated, the system may fail and \ncause an accident. Early disclosure of problems may result in damage to the employer \nand other employees; failure to disclose problems may result in damage to others.\nYou must make up your own mind in these matters. The appropriate ethical posi-\ntion here depends on the views of the people involved. The potential for damage, the \nextent of the damage, and the people affected by the damage should influence the \ndecision.

However, you should always try to resolve the \nsituation while respecting the rights of your employer.\nAnother ethical issue is participation in the development of military and nuclear \nsystems. Some people feel strongly about these issues and do not wish to participate in \nany systems development associated with defense systems. Others will work on mili-\ntary systems but not on weapons systems. Yet others feel that national security is an \noverriding principle and have no ethical objections to working on weapons systems.\nIn this situation, it is important that both employers and employees should make \ntheir views known to each other in advance. Where an organization is involved in \nmilitary or nuclear work, it should be able to specify that employees must be willing \nto accept any work assignment. Equally, if an employee is taken on and makes clear \nthat he or she does not wish to work on such systems, employers should not exert \npressure to do so at some later date.\nThe general area of ethics and professional responsibility is increasingly important \nas software-intensive systems pervade every aspect of work and everyday life. It can \nbe considered from a philosophical standpoint where the basic principles of ethics are \nconsidered and software engineering ethics are discussed with reference to these \nbasic principles. This is the approach taken by Laudon (Laudon 1995) and Johnson \n(Johnson 2001). More recent texts such as that by Tavani (Tavani 2013) introduce the \nnotion of cyberethics and cover both the philosophical background and practical and \nlegal issues. They include ethical issues for technology users as well as developers.\nI find that a philosophical approach is too abstract and difficult to relate to every-\nday experience so I prefer the more concrete approach embodied in professional \ncodes of conduct (Bott 2005; Duquenoy 2007). I think that ethics are best discussed \nin a software engineering context and not as a subject in its own right. Therefore, I \ndo not discuss software engineering ethics in an abstract way but include examples \nin the exercises that can be the starting point for a group discussion.\n \n1.3 Case studies\nTo illustrate software engineering concepts, I use examples from four different types \nof system.

It plays a crucial role in regulating the metabolism of glucose (sugar) in the blood.

It also helps to store excess glucose in the liver for later use.

The associations between the packages indicate there is an exchange \nof\u00a0information but, at this stage, there is no need to define them in any more detail.\nThe weather stations include instruments that measure weather parameters such \nas wind speed and direction, ground and air temperatures, barometric pressure, and \nrainfall over a 24-hour period. Each of these instruments is controlled by a software \nsystem that takes parameter readings periodically and manages the data collected \nfrom the instruments.\nThe weather station system operates by collecting weather observations at fre-\nquent intervals; for example, temperatures are measured every minute. However, \nbecause the bandwidth to the satellite is relatively narrow, the weather station carries \nout some local processing and aggregation of the data. It then transmits this aggre-\ngated data when requested by the data collection system. If it is impossible to make \na connection, then the weather station maintains the data locally until communica-\ntion can be resumed.\nEach weather station is battery-powered and must be entirely self-contained; there \nare no external power or network cables. All communications are through a relatively \nslow satellite link, and the weather station must include some mechanism (solar or \nwind power) to charge its batteries. As they are deployed in wilderness areas, they are \nexposed to severe environmental conditions and may be damaged by animals. The \nstation software is therefore not just concerned with data collection. It must also:\n1. Monitor the instruments, power. and communication hardware and report faults \nto the management system.\n2. Manage the system power, ensuring that batteries are charged whenever the \nenvironmental conditions permit but also that generators are shut down in \npotentially damaging weather conditions, such as high wind.\n\u00absystem\u00bb\nData management\nand archiving\n\u00absystem\u00bb\nStation maintenance\n\u00absystem\u00bb\nWeather station\nFigure 1.7 The weather \nstation\u2019s environment\n\n\n38\u2002 \u2002 Chapter\u20021\u2002 \u25a0\u2002 Introduction\n3. Allow for dynamic reconfiguration where parts of the software are replaced \nwith new versions and where backup instruments are switched into the system \nin the event of system failure.\nBecause weather stations have to be self-contained and unattended, this means \nthat the software installed is complex, even though the data collection functionality \nis fairly simple.\n \n1.3.4  A digital learning environment for schools\nMany teachers argue that using interactive software systems to support education \ncan lead to both improved learner motivation and a deeper level of knowledge and \nunderstanding in students. However, there is no general agreement on the \u2018best\u2019 \nstrategy for computer-supported learning, and teachers in practice use a range of dif-\nferent interactive, web-based tools to support learning. The tools used depend on the \nages of the learners, their cultural background, their experience with computers, \nequipment available, and the preferences of the teachers involved.\nA digital learning environment is a framework in which a set of general-purpose \nand specially designed tools for learning may be embedded, plus a set of applica-\ntions that are geared to the needs of the learners using the system. The framework \nprovides general services such as an authentication service, synchronous and asyn-\nchronous communication services, and a storage service.\nThe tools included in each version of the environment are chosen by teachers and \nlearners to suit their specific needs. These can be general applications such as spread-\nsheets, learning management applications such as a Virtual Learning Environment \n(VLE) to manage homework submission and assessment, games, and simulations. \nThey may also include specific content, such as content about the American Civil \nWar and applications to view and annotate that content.\nFigure 1.8 is a high-level architectural model of a digital learning environment \n(iLearn) that was designed for use in schools for students from 3 to 18 years of \nage. The approach adopted is that this is a distributed system in which all compo-\nnents of the environment are services that can be accessed from anywhere on the \nInternet. There is no requirement that all of the learning tools are gathered together \nin one place.\nThe system is a service-oriented system with all system components considered \nto be a replaceable service. There are three types of service in the system:\n1. Utility services that provide basic application-independent functionality and \nthat may be used by other services in the system. Utility services are usually \ndeveloped or adapted specifically for this system.\n2. \nApplication services that provide specific applications such as email, conferencing, \nphoto sharing, etc., and access to specific educational content such as scientific \nfilms or historical resources. Application services are external services that are \neither specifically purchased for the system or are available freely over the Internet."}
